# Bot Library UI Update - Vercel Style Grid

## Overview
Replaced the boxed "My Trading Bots" section with a borderless page + card grid design inspired by Vercel Projects.

## Changes Made

### New Components Created

#### 1. `components/bots/BotCard.jsx`
- Individual bot card component
- Features:
  - Clickable card that loads bot details
  - Activity icon indicator
  - Star/favorite toggle button
  - Delete button (more actions)
  - Bot name and description/URL
  - Status badges (branch, status)
  - Last run timestamp
  - Performance metrics (trades, return, win rate)
- Styling:
  - `rounded-2xl` borders
  - `border-white/10` subtle borders
  - `bg-[#0e1117]` card background
  - Hover effects: `hover:border-accent/50 hover:bg-white/5`
  - Focus rings for accessibility
  - Smooth transitions

#### 2. `components/bots/BotsGrid.jsx`
- Grid container with tab filtering
- Features:
  - All Bots / Favorites tabs (client-side filtering)
  - Maps backend bot data to card props
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Empty state handling for both tabs
- Data mapping:
  - `name` → bot name or "Untitled Bot"
  - `url` → description, symbol, or share_url
  - `updatedAt` → formatted date from created_at
  - `branch` → defaults to "main"
  - `isFavorite` → boolean from is_favorite
  - `status` → defaults to "ok"
  - Performance metrics passed through

#### 3. `components/bots/EmptyBots.jsx`
- Dedicated empty state component
- Friendly messaging with emoji
- Calls out "Build Bot" action

### Updated Components

#### `components/BotLibrary.jsx`
**Major Changes:**
- Removed boxed modal container (`bg-gray-800 rounded-lg`)
- Changed background from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-dark-bg` (full page)
- Implemented borderless page design with `max-w-6xl` container
- Removed duplicate filter tabs (now handled in BotsGrid)
- Simplified data fetching (always fetch all, filter client-side)
- Integrated new `BotsGrid` component
- Better loading state with spinner
- Enhanced error display

**What Stayed the Same:**
- All API endpoints and routes
- Authentication headers
- Data fetching logic
- Toggle favorite functionality
- Delete bot functionality
- Load bot details functionality
- Navbar and user menu
- Back button behavior

## Responsive Design

### Grid Breakpoints
- Mobile (`default`): 1 column
- Small (`sm:`): 2 columns
- Extra Large (`xl:`): 3 columns

### Card Behavior
- Cards are fully clickable to load bot details
- Buttons (favorite, delete) prevent card click propagation
- Keyboard accessible (Tab + Enter/Space)
- Touch-friendly hit targets

## Styling Tokens

### Colors (from index.css and tailwind.config.js)
- Background: `#0a0a0a` (dark-bg)
- Surface: `#1a1a1a` (dark-surface)
- Border: `#2a2a2a` (dark-border)
- Accent: `#7c3aed` (purple)
- Card background: `#0e1117` (slightly lighter than bg)

### Key Classes
- Cards: `rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-[#0e1117]`
- Hover: `hover:border-accent/50 hover:bg-white/5`
- Focus: `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-accent`
- Text: `text-white` (headings), `text-white/50` (muted)

## Accessibility

- Focus visible rings on all interactive elements
- Proper ARIA labels on icon buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast compliance

## Performance

- Client-side filtering (no extra API calls for favorites)
- Memoized bot list (useMemo for filtering)
- Efficient re-renders with proper React keys
- Lucide React icons (tree-shakeable)

## Data Flow

```
Backend API → BotLibrary (fetch) → BotsGrid (filter) → BotCard (render)
                                  ↓
                            User actions (favorite, delete, load)
                                  ↓
                            API calls → State update → Re-render
```
