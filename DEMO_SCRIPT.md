# Trading Bot Platform Demo Script
**Focus: Backtesting & Deployment Features**

---

## üéØ Introduction (30 seconds)
"Today I'm demoing our AI-powered trading bot platform that uses a multi-agent system to create, backtest, and deploy custom trading strategies. Let me show you how it works."

---

## üìä Part 1: Creating a Strategy with Backtesting (2-3 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Create Page
- **Action**: Click "Create Agent" or go to home page
- **Say**: "Let's start by creating a new trading strategy. Our platform uses multiple AI agents that work together - a Code Generator, Backtest Runner, and Strategy Analyst."

### Step 2: Enter a Trading Strategy
**Choose one of these example strategies:**

**Option A - Simple RSI Strategy:**
```
Buy AAPL when RSI drops below 30. Sell when RSI goes above 70.
```
**Say**: "I'll create a simple momentum strategy using RSI - a popular technical indicator."

**Option B - Sentiment-Based Strategy:**
```
Buy GME when r/wallstreetbets sentiment exceeds 0.5. Sell at 5% profit or 2% stop loss.
```
**Say**: "This strategy combines social media sentiment with risk management."

**Option C - Politician Trading (Impressive!):**
```
Mirror Nancy Pelosi's recent stock trades - buy when she buys, sell when she sells.
```
**Say**: "Our platform can even track politician trades and create strategies that follow their moves."

### Step 3: Watch the Multi-Agent System Work
- **Say**: "Watch as our AI agents collaborate in real-time:"
  - **Code Generator**: "First, it parses my request and generates the trading logic"
  - **Backtest Runner**: "Then it runs historical simulations across 180 days of market data"
  - **Strategy Analyst**: "Finally, it analyzes performance and suggests improvements"

### Step 4: Review Backtest Results
**Point out key metrics:**
- **Say**: "Here are our results:"
  - **Total Return**: "The strategy returned [X]% over the backtest period"
  - **Win Rate**: "It won [X]% of trades"
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: "Risk-adjusted returns show [X]"
  - **Trades Executed**: "[X] trades over 180 days"
  - **vs Buy & Hold**: "This outperformed/underperformed buy-and-hold by [X]%"

### Step 5: Explore the Charts
**Point to each visualization:**
- **Portfolio Performance Chart**:
  - **Say**: "This shows our strategy's performance vs buy-and-hold. The purple line is our bot, white line is buy-and-hold."

- **Trade Execution Chart**:
  - **Say**: "Green dots are entry points, red/green dots are exits showing profit or loss."

- **Strategy Insights (Dynamic Charts)**:
  - **Say**: "Our AI automatically generates relevant visualizations based on the strategy type."
  - **For RSI**: "Here you can see RSI values with buy/sell thresholds marked"
  - **For Sentiment**: "This shows sentiment scores over time with entry signals"

### Step 6: Chat with AI About Results
- **Action**: Click the chat icon in sidebar
- **Ask**: "Why did this strategy perform well/poorly?"
- **Say**: "I can ask our AI assistant questions about the strategy. It has full context of the backtest results and can explain the performance."

## üöÄ Part 2: Deployment (1-2 minutes)

### Step 7: Save the Bot
- **Action**: Click "Save to My Bots" or "Deploy" button
- **Say**: "Once I'm happy with the results, I can save this bot to my library."

### Step 8: Navigate to Bot Library
- **Action**: Go to "My Bots" page
- **Say**: "Here's my collection of saved trading bots. Each one shows key performance metrics."

### Step 9: View Deployment Status
- **Action**: Click on a saved bot
- **Say**: "I can view the full backtest results again, and when ready..."

### Step 10: Deploy (if implemented) / Show Deployment Plan
- **Action**: Click "Deploy" or "Connect to Alpaca"
- **Say**:
  - **If live**: "I can deploy this to run live with my Alpaca trading account. The bot will execute trades automatically based on these conditions."
  - **If not live**: "Our platform integrates with Alpaca for live paper trading and real trading deployment. The bot runs 24/7 monitoring market conditions."

## üåü Part 3: Community Features (1 minute)

### Step 11: Navigate to Community Page
- **Action**: Click "Community" in navigation
- **Say**: "Users can share their successful strategies with the community."

### Step 12: Browse Shared Strategies
- **Action**: Scroll through community agents
- **Say**: "Each strategy shows performance metrics - return, win rate, total trades. You can filter by performance or popularity."

### Step 13: Download/Clone a Strategy
- **Action**: Click on a community bot, then "Save to My Bots"
- **Say**: "I can clone any strategy to my own library, modify it, and backtest variations."
